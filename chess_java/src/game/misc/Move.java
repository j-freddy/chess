    Update: For now, I don't think this is necessary.
    Especially if we are only searching for all valid moves,
    it feels like a waste to compute the type of move.
    That feels only necessary when a player actually makes a move
    (Then we have to compute whether it's a check, etc.
    to write the notation correctly â€“ possibly...)
